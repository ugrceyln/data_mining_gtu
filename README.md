# Data Mining Notes


## Lecture Notes

    DataMining Lecture 1 (to 3)
    - Data, attributes and their types
    - Data quality and its problems and handle them
    - Correlation, covariance
    - Data analysis quantities like mean, variance, std etc.
    - Data preprocessing steps as aggregation, sampling, data reduction, feature selection, data transformation etc.
    - Similarity methods

    DataMining Lecture 4 (and left)
    - Frequent Patterns with
        - Association Rules
        - Apriori algorithm
        - FP-Growth Algorithm (with implementation)

## Project
    Data Mining techniques applied on Turbofan datasets
    
    - Data analysis with visualization via box plots, histograms, line plots
    - Detection outliers with different methods and catching them to train them properly
    - Correlations analysis
    - Train data with binary and multiclass classification models
    - Train models for RUL with regression methods
    - Compare models performance
    - Report all of steps
